### 1. Sign up on our Developer Platform

Head over to [Commerce-HUB](url) Developer platform and create an account.

### 2. Generate an API key

Go to the Apps page and create a Sandbox app.

Once you're on the Apps page copy your API key and Secret Key.

For most of our APIs you can just put the API Key into the header under the API-Key parameter. However, when you use our Payment APIs you'll need to add them to a [Message-Signature](Message-Signature.md) you an find out more about that in the next page.

### 3. Constructing the API call

Please refer our [API page](Use-Our-APIs.md) to know about how to use Commerce Hub APIs.
