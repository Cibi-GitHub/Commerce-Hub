## Payments-Orders


### Payments

The /payments API allows to create, inquire about, and finalize payment transactions.

Our Payments API has two main uses - 

- **Primary Transactions :** Primary transactions are typical [sale](../Transactions/Charges.md) transactions, [pre-authorisations](../Transactions/Charges.md).

- **Secondary Transactions :** Secondary Transactions let you refund a transaction, void a transaction or complete a pre-authorisation.
