## Card Not Present

Card Not Present (CNP) transactions are initiated when a customer does not physically present their payment source at the time of the transaction. Examples of CNP transactions include; online payments, in-app payments, and MOTO transactions.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> CNP transactions are at a higher risk for fraud, due to the inability to verify the account holder is making the purchase. To reduce the risk of card fraud it is recommended to use 3D Secure along with AVS and Security Code verification.
