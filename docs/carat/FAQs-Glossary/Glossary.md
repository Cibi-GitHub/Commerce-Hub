## Glossary

### Authorization
Authorization is necessary to check whether a card holder's credit card holds sufficient funds and is approved to purchase from a merchant. An authorization request first emerges whenever a cardholder attempts to purchase a good or service through a debit or credit card.

### Dynamic Descriptors
A custom descriptor you configure and pass with each transaction via the API. Some processors only support soft dynamic descriptors, while others support both hard and soft dynamic descriptors.

### Hard Descriptors
The descriptor that shows up after a transaction has settled. As soon as the customer's bank has finalized the transaction status, the hard descriptor will be permanently displayed as the description of the charge on the customerâ€™s statement. See also [Soft Descriptor](#Soft Descriptors)

### Pre-Auth

A pre-auth is a customer transaction where the merchant can validate a given amount is available on the customer payment method (physical card, digital wallet, etc.) and then also place a hold for that amount. This amount is held on the customer account (credit limit or bank balance), but not yet transferred to the merchant. Once the merchant initiates a [Capture](../Transactions/Capture.md) transaction, the held amount is then setled with the merchant batch.


### Sale
A sale is a customer transaction where the purchase amount is authorized and settled at the same time. If a sale is not voided [(Cancel)](../Transactions/Cancel.md) before batching, the merchant funding process begins for this charge. At this point,the merchant can still return funds [(Refund)](../Transactions/Refund.md) the customer.

### Soft Descriptors
The descriptor that shows up after a transaction has been authorized. As long as the charge is in a pending state, the soft descriptor will be displayed on the customer's statement.
