# Apple Pay: Web Integration


## Step 1: Create Merchant Identifier

First create a merchant identifier in your developer account that uniquely identifies you to Apple Pay as a merchant who is able to accept payments. You can use the same merchant identifier for multiple native and web apps. The merchant identifier never expires.

Refer Apple's [Create Merchant Identifier](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devb2e62b839?sub=dev103e030bb) for more details.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>
> After Merchant Identifier is created, you will need us to generate the certificate for you using the Merchant Identifier. Please contact our Account Representative in order to get the certificate.

---

## Step 2: Create Payment Processing Certificate

Next create a payment processing certificate that is associated with your merchant identifier and used to encrypt payment information. The payment processing certificate expires every 25 months and can be revoked. When that happens, just re-create the payment process certificate.


Refer Apple's [Create Payment Processing Certificate](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devb2e62b839?sub=devf31990e3f) for more details.

---


## Step 3: Register and Validate Merchant Account

Then register the merchant domains in your organization that will process the Apple Pay transactions and create a merchant identity certificate that youâ€™ll use to authenticate communication with the Apple Pay servers.

Refer Apple's [Register Merchant](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1731126fb) for more details.

---

## Step 4: Create Merchant Identity Certificate

Create a merchant identity certificate is required to authenticate communication with the Apple Pay servers.

Refer Apple's [Create Merchant Identity Certificate](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1731126fb?sub=dev17ad0bdc0) for more details.

---

## Step 5: Support Apple Pay on Website

Merchant can start supporting Apple Pay on their website either by using Apple Pay JS API Framework or by using Commerce Hub Hosted Payment Page.

**Integrate Using Apple Pay JS API:** For more details refer [Apple Pay JS API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api) documentation.

**Integrate Using Commerce Hub Hosted Page:** configure your apple pay settings in Commerce Hub Hosted Page.

---

## Step 6: Presenting the Payment Sheet

A merchant can enhance the purchase experience from their website by creating a streamlined checkout process and presenting a customized Apple Pay payment sheet that allows customers to promptly authorize a payment and complete their transaction. Refer to Apple's website on how to customize the [payment sheet](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay/overview/checkout-and-payment/#customize-the-payment-sheet).

---

## Step 7: Submit a Payment Request

<!--theme: warning-->
> This step is only required when utilizing Commerce Hub's RESTful API and Apple Pay JS. Hosted Checkout will manage the payment information automatically.
