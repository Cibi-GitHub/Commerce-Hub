### Mobile Wallets

Wallet transactions originate from a digital wallet from either a website or on a device (e.g. Apple/iOS, Google/Android, Samsung). Merchants can submit this data as either a encrypted or decrypted request. 

- **Encrypted Wallet:** The merchant will send the encrypted data along with their private key and Commerce Hub will decrypt the information for processing.
- **Decrypted Wallet:** The merchant will decrypt the wallet data before submitting to Commerce Hub for processing.
