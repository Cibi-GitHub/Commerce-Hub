# Reauthorize a Transaction

## Overview

A reauthorization with a token is required when a pending authorization has been released based on the card issuer's hold times. See an account representative for more information on issuer hold times. 

[Split shipment](../Guides-Info/Split-Shipment.md) is the most common type of reauthorization.

re-auth requirements will have an indicator and "transactionDetails":{        "primaryTransactionId": "transactionId"
