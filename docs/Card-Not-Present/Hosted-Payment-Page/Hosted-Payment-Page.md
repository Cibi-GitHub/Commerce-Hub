# Hosted Payment Page Integration

## Overview

The easiest way to add payment capabilities to merchant website is to implement a HTML form that the merchant can use to enable their customers to make a payment.

This type of integration helps merchants to let our Commerce HUB manage the customer redirections that are required in the checkout process of many payment methods or authentication mechanisms and gives merchants the option to use secure hosted pages which can reduce the burden of compliance with the Data Security Standard of the Payment Card Industry (PCI DSS).
