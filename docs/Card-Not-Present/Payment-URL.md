# Payment URL

## Overview

Merchant can use the /payment-url API to generate a URL that they can send to a customer, which they can then use to pay you. When the customer clicks on the payment URL, they are directed to Commerce Hub hosted payment page solution to make a payment, and the payment is routed to merchant store on our systems for processing.
