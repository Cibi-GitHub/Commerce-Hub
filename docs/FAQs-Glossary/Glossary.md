## Authorization
Authorization is necessary to check whether a card holder's credit card holds sufficient funds and is approved to purchase from a merchant. An authorization request first emerges whenever a cardholder attempts to purchase a good or service through a debit or credit card.

## Dynamic Descriptor
A custom descriptor you configure and pass with each transaction via the API. This includes both [Soft Descriptors](#soft-descriptor) and [Hard Descriptors](#hard-descriptor). Contact your account manager for more information on using Dynamic Descriptors.

## Hard Descriptor
The descriptor that shows up after a transaction has settled. As soon as the customer's bank has finalized the transaction status, the hard descriptor will be permanently displayed as the description of the charge on the customerâ€™s statement.

## Pre-Auth

A pre-auth is a customer transaction where the merchant can validate a given amount is available on the customer payment method (physical card, digital wallet, etc.) and then also place a hold for that amount. This amount is held on the customer account (credit limit or bank balance), but not yet transferred to the merchant. Once the merchant initiates a [Capture](../Transactions/Capture.md) transaction, the held amount is then setled with the merchant batch.

## Sale

A sale is a customer transaction where the purchase amount is authorized and settled at the same time. If a sale is not voided [(Cancel)](../Transactions/Cancel.md) before batching, the merchant funding process begins for this charge. At this point,the merchant can still return funds [(Refund)](../Transactions/Refund.md) the customer.

## Security Code

A card security code (CSC), card verification data (CVD), card verification number, card verification value (CVV), card verification value code, card verification code (CVC), verification code (V-code or V code), or signature panel code (SPC) is a security feature for card not present payment card transactions instituted to reduce credit card fraud.

## Soft Descriptor
The descriptor that shows up after a transaction has been authorized. As long as the charge is in a pending state, the soft descriptor will be displayed on the customer's statement.

## Tokenization
Tokenization is a process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. In the payments industry, it is used to safeguard a card's PAN by replacing it with a unique string of numbers.
